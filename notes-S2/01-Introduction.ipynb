    "\n",
    "In this session, we will dive into the first of those core steps: exploratory analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step should not be confused with data visualization or summary statistics. Those are merely tools... means to an end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper exploratory analysis is about answering questions. It's about extracting enough insights from your dataset to course correct before you get lost in the weeds.\n",

    "## Why explore your dataset upfront?\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of exploratory analysis is to **\"get to know\"** the dataset. Doing so upfront will make the rest of the project much smoother, in 3 main ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You’ll gain valuable hints for Data Cleaning (which can make or break your models).\n",
    "2. You’ll think of ideas for Feature Engineering (which can take your models from good to great).\n",
    "3. You’ll get a \"feel\" for the dataset, which will help you communicate results and deliver greater impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, exploratory analysis for machine learning should be **quick, efficient, and decisive**... not long and drawn out!\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t skip this step, but don’t get stuck on it either.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see [here](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/plots/top-50-matplotlib-visualizations-the-master-plots-python/), there are infinite possible plots, charts, and tables, but you only need a **handful** to \"get to know\" the data well enough to work with it.\n",
