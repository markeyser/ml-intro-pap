    "\n",
    "1. Scikit-Learn, which is the industry-standard Python library for Machine Learning, does not support missing data. Therefore, we need to transform those missing observations into numbers or remove them completely from the dataset. For this, we need to use missing data imputation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. But missing data imputation techniques may distort the original variable distribution and also the variable interactions, \n",
    "\n",
    "3. And this may affect the machine learning model performance because some models are making some assumptions over the variable distribution. \n",
    "\n",
