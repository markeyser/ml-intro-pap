    "- $\\beta$ indicates the change in $Y$ per unit change of $X$\n",
    "- If $X$ changes scale, $\\beta$ will change its value\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, if $X$ is a distance variable, just changing the scale from Kilometers to miles, will cause a change in the magnitude of the coefficient $\\beta$. \n",

    "- Regression coefficients depend on the magnitude of the variable\n",
    "- Features with bigger magnitudes dominate over features with small magnitudes\n",

    "So, in general, as much as possible, we want to have all the variables within a similar scale. "

    "- Gradient descent converges faster when features are on similar scales. Therefore, feature magnitude is also important for Neural Networks.\n",
    "- Feature scaling helps decrease the time to find support vectors for SVMs\n",
    "- Methods using Euclidean distances (or distances in general) are sensitive to feature magnitude as the distances are also sensitive to variations in the magnitude or scale of the predictors. Therefore, feature scaling is also required for methods that utilize distances calculations like near-neighbors and k-means clustering. "
