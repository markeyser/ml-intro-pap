    "\n",
    "Well, depending on the context, outliers either deserve special attention or should be completely ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see, for example, in revenue forecasting. If an unusual spike of revenue is observed, it is probably a good idea to pay extra attention and try and figured out what caused that spike. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way, if an unusual transaction in the credit card appears we may want a different look at it because maybe a sign of fraudulent activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in instances like these, it is useful to look for and investigate further those outlier values.\n",
    "\n",
    "If outliers, however, are introduced by mechanical error or measurement error or anything else that cannot be generalizable it is a good idea to filter out those outliers before feeding the data into a modeling algorithm. "
