    "\n",
    "- First, scikit-learn, which is the standard Python library for machine learning, does not support strings as inputs. Therefore, we need to transform those strings into numbers if we want to use them. \n",
    "- Second, highly cardinal variables mainly may lead to an uneven distribution of the labels between the train and test sets. \n",
    "- Which may derive in overfitting particularly in tree-based algorithms\n",
    "- Or operational problems when we want to use those models live."
