    "Pandas is one of the most popular Python libraries for Data Science and Analytics. I like to say it’s the “SQL of Python.” Why? Because pandas helps you to manage two-dimensional data tables in Python. Of course, it has many more features. In this pandas tutorial series, I’ll show you the most important (that is, the most often used) things that you have to know as an Analyst or a Data Scientist. This is the first episode and we will start from the basics!"
